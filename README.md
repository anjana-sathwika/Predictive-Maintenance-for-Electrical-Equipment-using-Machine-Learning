# Predictive Maintenance for Electrical Equipment using Machine Learning and MATLAB

### Project Description

#### Introduction
Predictive maintenance (PdM) leverages machine learning techniques to predict when electrical equipment might fail, allowing for proactive maintenance. This approach minimizes downtime, reduces maintenance costs, and extends the lifespan of the equipment. This project aims to develop a machine learning model in MATLAB to predict failures in electrical equipment based on historical data and sensor readings.

#### Objectives
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather historical maintenance data and sensor readings from electrical equipment.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract and select relevant features from the raw data to improve model performance.
3. **Model Development**: Develop and train machine learning models to predict equipment failures.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and select the best performing one.
5. **Deployment**: Implement the predictive maintenance model in a MATLAB environment for real-time monitoring and alerts.

#### Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
    - Collect historical data including timestamps, sensor readings (e.g., voltage, current, temperature), and maintenance logs.
    - Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and noise.
    - Normalize and scale the data for better model performance.

2. **Feature Engineering**
    - Generate additional features such as moving averages, standard deviations, and other statistical measures.
    - Use domain knowledge to create features that might be indicative of impending failures (e.g., increasing temperature trend).

3. **Model Development**
    - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
    - Develop and train various machine learning models such as:
        - **Supervised Learning Models**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks.
        - **Unsupervised Learning Models**: K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for anomaly detection.
    - Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

4. **Model Evaluation**
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC).
    - Perform a comparative analysis of different models to select the best one.

5. **Deployment**
    - Integrate the selected model into a MATLAB application.
    - Develop a user-friendly interface to visualize real-time sensor data and predictions.
    - Implement alert systems to notify maintenance teams when the model predicts a high risk of failure.

#### Tools and Technologies
- **MATLAB**: For data preprocessing, model development, and deployment.
- **MATLAB Toolboxes**: Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, Deep Learning Toolbox.
- **Version Control**: Git for version control and collaboration.

#### Expected Outcomes
- A robust machine learning model capable of predicting failures in electrical equipment with high accuracy.
- A MATLAB application for real-time monitoring and alerting, enabling proactive maintenance.
- Reduced downtime and maintenance costs, and improved equipment lifespan.
